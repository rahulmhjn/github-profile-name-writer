Make a new repo (say testRepo)
Run the file run.sh, it will ask you the information like username and id, enter it.
You will obtain	a file runThis.sh, just copy that file in your cloned version of testRepo and run it, that's all...

How to select date from which I want to start writing my name####

That's simple, go to you profile page and select a base block from which you want to start writing your name, just inspect element it, you will see a value for data-date, this is it.
The first quantity is year, second is month and third is date, just add these info when you run the script run.sh

For help, here are two screenshots

What if I want to change the pattern of some alphabets.####

Now that's simple, go to the components folder, you will find a file named alphabets, just draw your pattern in that file, run bash parse.sh and that's it, your final output is in finalIndexing.txt, just replace all this obtained value of variables and arrays in the file main.py (replacing the old one). Now what are you waiting for, go and run your newly customized main.py. :smile:
What about numbers.?####

I'll add them soon, but you know what, you can also fork the repository, go give it a shot.
Edit :- Numbers are added.

Is this a useful thing..?####

No not at all.. hahhahahahahaha. :D, it's just for fun and for making your github profile awesome, go see this link -> https://github.com/ironmaniiith
If you are behind a proxy and your proxy don't allow ssh to github, follow this####

Suppose you username is 'ironman' and password is 'blablapassword'

Just run this in you local copy of the repository

git remote rm origin

git remote add origin "https://ironman:blablapassword@github.com/ironman/testRepo.git" (where testRepo is the name of you repository in which your commits will be going)

Now just run the final script runThis.sh, it won't ask for the password

What more.?####

Well dude, I'm not a poet or essay writer :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: , so unfortunately you won't find anything more. ;-)
Any suggestions are always welcomed.

Don't forget to :star:star:star: the repo if you like it...
